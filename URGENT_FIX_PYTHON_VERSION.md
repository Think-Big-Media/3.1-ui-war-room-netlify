# üö® URGENT: Fix Python Version in Render Dashboard

## The Problem
Deployment is failing with:
```
The PYTHON_VERSION must provide a major, minor, and patch version, e.g. 3.8.1. 
You have requested 3.11.
```

## Immediate Fix Required

### For Comet Browser:
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d2dm57mmcj7s73c76dh0/env
2. Find the environment variable: `PYTHON_VERSION`
3. Current value: `3.11` ‚ùå
4. Change it to: `3.11.0` ‚úÖ
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. This will trigger automatic redeployment

### Alternative: Remove the Variable
If changing doesn't work:
1. DELETE the `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable entirely
2. The .python-version file in the repo will take over (already set to 3.11.0)

## Why This Keeps Happening
- Render dashboard environment variables OVERRIDE file settings
- We fixed it in files but dashboard still has wrong value
- Dashboard takes priority over repo files

## Verification
After fixing:
- Deployment should start successfully
- No more Python version errors
- Site will be live in 5-10 minutes

## Current Status
- ‚ùå Deployment failing due to Python version
- ‚úÖ JavaScript has Supabase credentials embedded
- ‚úÖ All other configurations correct
- ‚è≥ Just need to fix PYTHON_VERSION to 3.11.0

**ACTION NEEDED: Change PYTHON_VERSION from "3.11" to "3.11.0" in Render Dashboard NOW**
