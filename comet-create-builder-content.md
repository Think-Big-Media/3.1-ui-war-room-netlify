# Comet: Create Content in Builder.io for War Room

Great news! The Builder.io integration IS working - we can see it's connected. Now we just need to create content in Builder.io.

## Current Status:
âœ… Builder.io is connected to your site
âœ… The routing is working (/builder/test loads)
âœ… It's asking for content to be created

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Go to Builder.io Content
- Log into https://builder.io
- Make sure you're in the "War Room Platform" space
- Click on "Content" in the left sidebar

### 2. Create a New Page
- Click the "+ New Entry" button
- Choose "Page" as the model type
- **IMPORTANT**: Set the URL to exactly: `/builder/test`
- Don't add https:// or the domain, just: `/builder/test`

### 3. Add Some Content
- Once in the visual editor:
  - Drag a "Text" block onto the canvas
  - Type: "ðŸŽ‰ Builder.io is successfully connected to War Room!"
  - Maybe add an image or button to test
  - You can drag in any of these registered War Room components:
    - Dashboard
    - CommandCenter
    - FeatureCard
    - RecentActivity

### 4. Publish the Page
- Click the "Publish" button in the top right
- Make sure it says "Published" not "Draft"

### 5. Verify It's Live
- Go back to: https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com/builder/test
- You should now see your content instead of "No content found"
- It may take 30 seconds for the cache to clear

## If Content Still Doesn't Show:

1. **Check the URL path in Builder**: Must be exactly `/builder/test`
2. **Check it's published**: Not in draft mode
3. **Check the Preview URL**: Should be set to `https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com`
4. **Hard refresh the page**: Cmd+Shift+R to clear cache

## Success Indicator:
When it's working, instead of "No content found for this page", you'll see your actual content from Builder.io!

The connection is working - we just need to give it something to display!
