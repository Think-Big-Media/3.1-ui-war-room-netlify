### Performance Test Files

Performance test results are stored in `tests/performance/results/`:

- **JSON Results**: Raw k6 test output with detailed metrics
- **Log Files**: Detailed test execution logs
- **Summary Reports**: Markdown summaries of test runs

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Issues

1. **Cold Start Delays**
   - **Symptom**: First request takes 30+ seconds
   - **Solution**: Verify GitHub Actions keep-warm is running
   - **Prevention**: Monitor keep-warm schedule

2. **Slow Analytics Queries**
   - **Symptom**: Analytics endpoints > 1s response time
   - **Solution**: Check database query performance, verify caching
   - **Prevention**: Regular query optimization reviews

3. **High Error Rates**
   - **Symptom**: Error rate > 5%
   - **Solution**: Check service health, database connectivity
   - **Prevention**: Comprehensive error monitoring

### Performance Debugging

```bash
# Run diagnostic performance test
k6 run k6-scripts/simple-baseline.js --out json=debug.json

# Check specific endpoint performance
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s "https://war-room-oa9t.onrender.com/health"

# Monitor service health
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

Performance tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Pre-deployment Testing**: Performance smoke tests on pull requests
2. **Post-deployment Validation**: Full performance suite after deployments  
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular performance regression testing
4. **Performance Budgets**: Automated alerts on performance degradation

### Performance Gates

Deployment gates based on performance criteria:

- All health checks must pass
- Response time must be within 110% of baseline
- Error rate must be < 5%
- No critical performance regressions

## Getting Started

### Setting Up Performance Testing

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install k6
   brew install k6
   
   # Verify installation
   k6 version
   ```

2. **Run Your First Test**
   ```bash
   cd tests/performance
   chmod +x run-tests.sh
   ./run-tests.sh health production
   ```

3. **Review Results**
   - Check console output for immediate results
   - Review JSON files in `results/` directory
   - Read generated summary reports

### Best Practices

- Run tests during off-peak hours for production
- Use consistent test environments
- Document performance changes
- Set up automated monitoring
- Review performance trends regularly

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set up real-time performance dashboards
2. **Load Testing**: Conduct higher load tests (20+ concurrent users)
3. **Stress Testing**: Test system breaking points
4. **Performance Budgets**: Implement automated performance gates
5. **User Experience**: Add real user monitoring (RUM)
