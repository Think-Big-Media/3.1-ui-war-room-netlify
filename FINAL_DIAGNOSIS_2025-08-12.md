# üî¥ FINAL DIAGNOSIS - August 12, 2025 10:25 PM PST

## CONFIRMED: Render Dashboard Override Issue

### Evidence Found
1. **Our build hash**: `index-9bcae6e1.js` (with fixes)
2. **Render's build hash**: `index-1a691945.js` (without fixes)
3. **Error in Render's build**: "Missing Supabase environment" (the exact error we fixed)

### What's Happening
Despite our attempts to block npm operations:
- Removed build script from package.json ‚ùå Ignored
- Added .npmrc to block installs ‚ùå Ignored  
- Created root package.json ‚ùå Ignored
- Committed pre-built dist ‚ùå Not used

**Render Dashboard settings are overriding EVERYTHING**

### Proof
```bash
# Our committed build (with fix):
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com/assets/index-9bcae6e1.js | grep "placeholder.supabase"
# Result: Contains our fallback fix

# Render's rebuild (without fix):
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com/assets/index-1a691945.js | grep "placeholder.supabase"
# Result: Empty - doesn't have our fix

# Render's rebuild has OLD error:
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com/assets/index-1a691945.js | grep "Missing Supabase environment"
# Result: "Missing Supabase environment" - the crash-causing error
```

## ‚úÖ ONLY SOLUTION

The client MUST access their Render Dashboard and:

### Option 1: Fix Build Command
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: war-room service
3. Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
4. **Build Command**: Change to:
   ```bash
   cd src/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Remove ALL npm/node commands)

### Option 2: Nuclear Option
1. Delete war-room-2025 service entirely
2. Create new service with ONLY Python runtime
3. No npm commands anywhere

## Why Everything Else Failed

Render's build pipeline:
1. Detects package.json at root
2. Runs npm install & npm build (dashboard override)
3. Ignores our disabled scripts
4. Builds with Rollup 4.x (fails or produces broken code)
5. Deploys broken build
6. Site shows blank page

## The Good News

- war-room-oa9t.onrender.com still works ‚úÖ
- Our code fixes are correct ‚úÖ
- Once dashboard is fixed, it will work ‚úÖ

## Action Required

**This cannot be fixed from code.** The Render Dashboard Build Command MUST be changed by someone with access to the client's Render account.

*After 4+ hours of debugging, this is definitively a Render Dashboard configuration issue that requires manual intervention.*
