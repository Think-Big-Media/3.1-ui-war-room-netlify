# FORCE RENDER REBUILD - CRITICAL

This file forces Render to detect a change and rebuild.

Timestamp: Thu Aug 14 09:51:30 CEST 2025
Build ID: FORCE-2025-08-14-0951

## What MUST happen:
1. Backend: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Frontend: cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run build
3. BOTH must complete for UI changes to show

## UI Changes waiting to deploy:
- Slate/gray theme (not purple)
- No page headers
- No navigation icons
- Tab overflow prevention

If you don't see these changes after deployment, the frontend was NOT built.
