# Builder.io Integration Diagnostic for War Room 3.0

Please perform a comprehensive diagnostic of the Builder.io integration status for War Room 3.0 UI.

## Production Site
URL: https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com

## What to Check

### 1. Test Builder.io Routes
Visit these URLs and report what you see:
- https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com/builder/test
- https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com/builder/landing
- https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com/builder

For each URL, report:
- Does it load successfully (200) or give 404?
- What content is displayed?
- Any error messages in browser console?

### 2. Check Builder.io API Integration
Open browser DevTools Network tab and look for:
- Requests to builder.io API
- API key being sent (should be: 8686f311497044c0932b7d2247296478)
- Response status codes
- Any CORS errors

### 3. Verify Component Registration
In browser console, check if Builder components are registered:
```javascript
window.Builder && window.Builder.components
```

### 4. Builder.io Dashboard Settings
Log into Builder.io (https://builder.io) and verify:
- Space name: War Room Platform
- Preview URL setting (should be: https://war-room-3-ui.onrender.com)
- API key matches: 8686f311497044c0932b7d2247296478
- Any content created for /builder/test path

### 5. Check JavaScript Bundle
View page source and verify:
- Is @builder.io/react included in the bundle?
- Are the routes properly configured?
- Any build errors preventing Builder from loading?

## Actions to Take

Based on your findings:

1. **If routes return 404**: The routing may not be deployed correctly
2. **If "No content found"**: Create test content in Builder.io
3. **If API errors**: Check API key configuration
4. **If components not registered**: Check builder-registry.tsx loading
