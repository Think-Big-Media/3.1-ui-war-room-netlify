*War Room • Documentation Package Overview*

Prepared for **Think Big Media** • Version 1.0 • 03 Jul 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This package contains **10 purpose-built documents** that define, secure and guide the **6–8-week** build of War Room—an AI-powered political-marketing command centre. Together they:

- lock scope and success metrics (PRD)

• describe system & data architecture (Tech Arch + Schema/API)

• translate goals into stories, timeline and QA (User Stories, Timeline, Test Plan)

• guarantee legal & security compliance (Security Reqs)

• ensure smooth deployment and long-term maintainability (Railway → AWS Infra Plan, Logs & Reports).

Everything is written so a new engineer or executive can understand, audit and extend the product without tribal knowledge.

## 2. How to Navigate the Package

| # | File | Purpose | When to Read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | **Project Requirements Document** | What we will build & why | First—sets context |
| 02 | Technical Architecture | How components fit together | When evaluating tech stack |
| 03 | Database Schema & API | Table definitions & endpoints | During integration work |
| 04 | User Stories & Acceptance | Feature-level details | During backlog grooming |
| 05 | Development Timeline | Sprint-by-sprint roadmap | Weekly check-ins |
| 06 | Testing & QA Plan | Quality gates & tooling | Before QA cycles |
| 07 | Security & Compliance | Political data controls | Security/legal review |
| 08 | Deployment & Infra | CI/CD, rollback, DR | Release preparation |
| 09 | Daily Dev Log Template | Day-to-day progress capture | Every workday |
| 10 | Weekly Status Report Template | Exec-level progress snapshot | Every Friday |

*All filenames are prefixed with a two-digit order so they appear sequentially in Notion.*

## 3. Project Overview & Key Decisions

- **Scope:** Contracted feature set delivered in **6–8 weeks** via AI-assisted solo development.

• **Deployment Strategy:** **Phase 1 on Railway (US region)** for speed & collaboration → **Phase 2 migration to AWS us-east-2** for “fortress-level” security.

• **Stack:** React (Railway) · Supabase (Postgres, Storage, Edge) · Pinecone · LangChain/LangGraph · OpenAI → optional Bedrock fallback.

• **Roles:** `admin`, `member` only for MVP—simplifies RLS and UI.

• **Primary live data source:** Meta Ads (Google Ads flagged for Phase 2).

• **Cost Cap:** Stack ≤ USD 145/mo; token spend ≤ USD 0.30 user/day.  **Total development budget:** **USD 22,500** (per signed contract).

• **Real-time monitoring:** Integrations for Mentionlytics & NewsWhip plus Twitter/Facebook sentiment and crisis-alert workflows baked into Phase-2/3 milestones.

• **Compliance:** All data stored in US regions; immutable spend/audit logs for FEC.

• **Team:** 4 US-based client collaborators + 1 France-based lead developer; async-first workflow.

• **Risk Mitigation (CTO review):** 2-week buffer added, Meta API application filed Day 0, OpenAI cost alerts, vendor exit strategy documented.

All later feature ideas (WhatsApp, multi-platform metrics, billing, etc.) are documented but gated behind flags for post-launch.

## 4. Next Steps & Client Actions

| Due | Action | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Jul 08** | Provide brand assets & **file Meta API application** | Think Big Media |
| Jul 08 | Review & e-sign Sections 1–4 of PRD (scope lock) | Think Big Media |
| Jul 10 | Slack channel & Notion guest access confirmed | Both |
| Weekly (Fridays) | Attend 15-min demo & approve sprint deliverables | Product Owner |
| Launch-1 week | Approve marketing copy & DNS cut-over | Marketing Lead |

---

## 5. Notion Upload & Organisation Instructions

1. Create a **“War Room • Documentation”** top-level page.
2. Drag & drop all `.md` files; Notion will auto-render markdown.
3. Use the suggested **page order** (00→10) for linear reading.
4. Add a **Status** property to each page (`Draft`/`In Review`/`Approved`).
5. Set page permissions: `Can edit` for development team, `Can comment` for client reviewers.

*Pro-tip: enable Notion “Updated” column to surface recently changed docs.*

---

## 6. Document Maintenance & Update Procedures

| Trigger | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Scope or design change | Update PRD §10, bump version e.g., 1.1, tag commit `doc/prd-v1.1`. |
| Schema change | Edit 03-Database doc + Supabase migration; increment doc version. |
| Security finding | Update 07-Security doc + create Notion task; mark **HIGH** priority. |
| End of each sprint | Archive Daily Logs to `/logs/` folder; attach Weekly Report to 05-Timeline page. |
| All docs live in `/docs/` folder of repo; CI checks disallow merge if doc version missing for related code change. |  |
