## Potential Review Questions

### **Q: Why do you need access to Facebook advertising data?**

The unified analytics help campaigns save time and improve their return on advertising spend.

### **Q: How do you protect user data?**

### **Q: How do users benefit from this integration?**
**A**: Campaign managers can see all their advertising performance in one place, compare effectiveness across platforms, receive AI-powered optimization recommendations, and save 10+ hours per week that would otherwise be spent switching between different advertising platforms.
