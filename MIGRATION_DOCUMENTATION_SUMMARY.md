## üöÄ Quick Start Migration Guide

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration (Day -1)
1. **Read**: `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` - sections 1-3
2. **Setup**: Client Render.com account and external services
3. **Prepare**: Run `backup_scripts/export_data.sh` to create migration package
4. **Validate**: Verify all credentials and access in `CREDENTIAL_HANDOVER.md`

### Phase 2: Migration Day (4-6 hours)
1. **Follow**: `MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` phases 1-8
2. **Reference**: `RENDER_MIGRATION.md` for detailed instructions
3. **Configure**: Use `.env.render.template` for environment setup
4. **Import**: Run `backup_scripts/import_data.sh` with migration package

### Phase 3: Post-Migration (Week 1)
1. **Setup**: Follow `CLIENT_SETUP.md` for admin configuration
2. **Secure**: Complete all tasks in `CREDENTIAL_HANDOVER.md`

## üîß Migration Tools and Scripts

### Backup Scripts
```bash
# Export current data (run in current environment)
./backup_scripts/export_data.sh

# Import to new environment (run in new deployment)
./backup_scripts/import_data.sh war_room_migration_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz

# Validate package only (without importing)
./backup_scripts/import_data.sh --validate-only migration_package.tar.gz
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Environment template location
.env.render.template

# Current configuration reference
RENDER_CONFIGURATION.md

# Copy template to new Render service environment variables
# (via Render dashboard - never commit with real values)
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Critical Security Tasks
- [ ] **Rotate all secrets** after migration (JWT_SECRET, SECRET_KEY)
- [ ] **Replace temporary credentials** with client-owned accounts
- [ ] **Enable 2FA** on all admin accounts
- [ ] **Verify CORS settings** allow only production domains
- [ ] **Update DNS records** only after full validation

### Credential Management
- **Current Deployment**: Temporary access provided for migration
- **External Services**: Client must provide their own accounts
- **Security Keys**: Auto-generated by Render in new environment
- **API Keys**: Must be rotated to client-owned services
