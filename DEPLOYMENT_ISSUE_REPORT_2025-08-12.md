# War Room Deployment Issue Report - August 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Status**: war-room-2025.onrender.com shows blank page despite multiple deployment attempts  
**Root Cause**: Multiple cascading issues including Rollup build failures, Supabase environment variable crashes, and Render configuration mismatches  
**Duration**: ~3 hours of debugging (6:00 PM - 9:35 PM PST)  
**Current State**: Site deploys but shows blank page due to JavaScript runtime errors

---

## Background

### Two Render Services Exist:
1. **war-room-oa9t.onrender.com** (Old - Think Big Media workspace)
   - Owner: Personal account (not client's)
   - Status: WORKING ‚úÖ
   - Issue: Client doesn't own this, political/ownership problem

2. **war-room-2025.onrender.com** (New - War Room AI workspace)  
   - Owner: Client's account
   - Status: BLANK PAGE ‚ùå
   - Issue: Was working for 24 hours until today's changes

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11)
- **Deployment**: Render.com
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Supabase
- **Build Tools**: Vite 5.4.0 ‚Üí 4.5.0, Rollup 4.x ‚Üí 3.29.4

## Timeline of Issues

### 6:00 PM - Initial State
- User reported Meta/Google analytics features were added
- Attempted to deploy to war-room-2025
- Discovered deployment was showing blank page

### 6:30 PM - Rollback Attempt
- Rolled back to commit `6e73eb6fb` (yesterday's "working" deployment)
- Force pushed to trigger deployment
- Result: Still blank page

### 7:00 PM - Rollup Build Issues
- **Problem**: Rollup 4.x has native module issues with npm
- **Error**: `Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`
- **Attempted fixes**:
  - Added `--omit=optional` flag
  - Added `.npmrc` with `omit=optional`
  - Set environment variable `ROLLUP_SKIP_NODE_BUILD`
  - Manually installed platform-specific modules
- **Solution**: Downgraded to Rollup 3.29.4 + Vite 4.5.0

### 7:30 PM - Path Issues
- **Problem**: Python server couldn't find dist/ folder
- **Cause**: Root Directory set to `src/backend` but dist/ at repo root
- **Fix**: Copied dist/ to src/backend/dist/

### 8:00 PM - Deployment Confusion
- **Issue**: Confused about which service was deploying
- **war-room-oa9t**: On Think Big Media workspace (personal)
- **war-room-2025**: On War Room AI workspace (client's)
- Multiple attempts to fix the wrong service

### 8:30 PM - API URL Configuration
- **Problem**: Frontend hardcoded to localhost:8000
- **Fix**: Updated to use relative URLs in production:
  ```javascript
  const API_BASE_URL = window.location.hostname === 'localhost' 
    ? 'http://localhost:8000' 
    : '';
  ```

### 9:00 PM - Supabase Crash Discovery
- **CRITICAL FINDING**: App throws error when Supabase env vars missing
- **Location**: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` line 13
- **Code causing crash**:
  ```javascript
  if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseAnonKey) {
    throw new Error('Missing Supabase environment variables');
  }
  ```
- **Fix Applied**:
  ```javascript
  const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL || 'https://placeholder.supabase.co';
  const supabaseAnonKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY || 'placeholder-key';
  
  if (!import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL) {
    console.warn('Missing Supabase environment variables');
  }
  ```

### 9:30 PM - Build Configuration Mismatch
- **Discovery**: war-room-2025 shows different JS hash than our builds
- **Our build**: `index-76cc1466.js`
- **war-room-2025 serves**: `index-df482586.js`
- **Conclusion**: Render is rebuilding frontend, not using pre-built files

---

## Current Problems

### 1. Build Process Mismatch
- **Expected**: Use pre-built dist/ folder committed to repo
- **Actual**: Render appears to be running `npm run build` 
- **Result**: Different build output, missing our fixes

### 2. Render Configuration Issues
The render.yaml in repo shows:
```yaml
buildCommand: |
  cd src/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
```

But war-room-2025 might have different settings in dashboard:
- Possibly includes `npm install && npm run build`
- Root Directory might be set to `src/backend`
- Auto-deploy might be intermittent

### 3. Environment Variables
- Supabase credentials not set on war-room-2025
- App was crashing without them (now fixed with fallbacks)
- Other potential missing vars:
  - `VITE_API_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

---

## Files Modified

### Critical Files Changed:
1. **package.json**
   - Rollup: 4.x ‚Üí 3.29.4
   - Vite: 5.4.0 ‚Üí 4.5.0

2. **src/lib/supabase/client.ts**
   - Added fallback values
   - Changed throw Error to console.warn

3. **src/config/constants.ts**
   - Updated API_BASE_URL to use relative URLs
   - Added Supabase fallbacks

4. **render.yaml**
   - Removed `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Removed NODE_VERSION env var

5. **Distribution folders**:
   - dist/ (repo root)
   - src/dist/ 
   - src/backend/dist/

### Meta/Google Features (Preserved in patch):
- `src/components/campaign-control/PlatformAnalytics.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/campaign-control/CampaignTabs.tsx` (modified)
- `src/components/integrations/MetaIntegration.tsx` (modified)

## What Works vs What Doesn't

### ‚úÖ Working:
- war-room-oa9t.onrender.com (old service)
- GitHub commits and pushes
- Local development environment
- Backend API (/health endpoint returns healthy)
- Building locally with Rollup 3.29.4 + Vite 4.5.0

### ‚ùå Not Working:
- war-room-2025.onrender.com frontend (blank page)
- Render using our pre-built files
- Automatic deployment triggering consistently

---

## Diagnostic Commands Run

```bash
# Check deployment status
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com | grep -o "index-[^\"]*\.js"

# Check API health
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com/health

# Check if our fix is in deployed code
curl -s https://war-room-2025.onrender.com/assets/index-df482586.js | grep -o "placeholder.supabase.co"

## Stack Overflow Research

Common causes of React blank page on deployment:
1. **Missing environment variables** ‚úÖ (Fixed with fallbacks)
2. **BrowserRouter vs HashRouter issues** (Not addressed)
3. **Homepage field in package.json** (Not set - OK)
4. **Build folder not fully uploaded** (Using Git - OK)
5. **JavaScript runtime errors** ‚úÖ (Supabase crash fixed)
6. **CORS/CSP headers** (Backend configured correctly)

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Check Render Dashboard for war-room-2025**:
   - Build Command should be: `cd src/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Root Directory should be: ` ` (blank) or `.`
   - Start Command should be: `cd src/backend && python serve_bulletproof.py`
   - Remove any npm/node commands

2. **Set Environment Variables on war-room-2025**:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<actual_value>
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<actual_value>
   PYTHON_VERSION=3.11
   ```

3. **Clear Render Cache**:
   - Manual Deploy ‚Üí Clear Build Cache ‚Üí Deploy

4. **Alternative: Nuclear Option**:
   - Delete war-room-2025 service
   - Recreate with correct settings
   - Ensure NO npm commands in build

### Long-term Solutions:

1. **Separate Frontend/Backend Services**:
   - Deploy React to Vercel/Netlify
   - Deploy FastAPI to Render
   - Avoid build complexity

2. **Use Docker**:
   - Create Dockerfile with pre-built frontend
   - Deploy container to Render
   - Guaranteed consistency

3. **Environment Variable Management**:
   - Use `.env.example` with all required vars
   - Document which vars are required vs optional
   - Add validation on startup

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Rollup 4.x is broken** with npm's optional dependency handling
2. **Supabase client crashes** without proper error handling
3. **Render caches aggressively** - empty commits help force rebuilds
4. **Pre-built vs Build-on-deploy** - mixing approaches causes hash mismatches
5. **Multiple workspaces** add confusion - verify which service is deploying
6. **Root Directory setting** is critical for Python+React monorepos

---

## Files Created for Debugging

- `meta-google-features.patch` - Preserved features during rollback
- `monitor-deployment.sh` - Deployment monitoring script
- `check-deployments.sh` - Multi-deployment status checker
- `diagnose-blank-page.html` - Browser-based diagnostic tool
- `check-console-errors.html` - JavaScript error checker

---

## Current Theory

**war-room-2025 is rebuilding the frontend on Render** instead of using our pre-built files. This creates different file hashes and doesn't include our fixes. The blank page is likely because:

1. Old code without Supabase crash fix is deployed
2. Supabase env vars are missing
3. App throws error and shows blank page

The solution is to ensure Render uses our pre-built dist/ folder and doesn't run any npm commands.
