# Meta API UI Integration Summary

## Dashboard Updates

### 1. Real-Time Meta Campaign Metrics
- Replaced mock data with live Meta campaign data
- Integrated `useMetaCampaigns` hook for real-time updates
- Added account connection status indicator
- Dynamic metric calculations based on actual campaign data

### 2. New Components Created

#### MetaCampaignInsights Component
```typescript
// src/frontend/src/components/dashboard/MetaCampaignInsights.tsx
- Displays real-time Meta campaign performance
- Shows active campaigns, budgets, and performance metrics
- Handles authentication states gracefully
- Responsive grid layout with motion animations
```

### 3. Updated Dashboard Metrics

**Before (Mock Data):**
- Active Volunteers: 2,847
- Total Donations: $124,560
- Upcoming Events: 18
- Engagement Rate: 73.2%

**After (Live Meta Data):**
- Active Campaigns: Live count from Meta API
- Ad Spend (Meta): Calculated from campaign budgets
- Total Budget: Sum of all campaign budgets
- Engagement Rate: Real performance metrics

### 4. Campaign Health Integration
- Extended CampaignHealth component to accept Meta campaigns
- Added Meta campaign health metric calculation
- Real-time status updates based on campaign states

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication Flow
- OAuth tokens stored in context, not exposed
- Account ID validation before API calls
- Graceful handling of auth failures

### 2. Data Protection
- No sensitive data logged to console
- Error messages sanitized
- API keys never exposed in frontend

### 3. Rate Limiting
- Hooks respect rate limits from backend
- Caching strategy prevents excessive API calls
- Query invalidation only when necessary

## Next Steps for Full Integration

### 1. Campaign Control Page
```typescript
// TODO: Wire up CRUD operations
- Create campaign wizard
- Edit campaign modal
- Bulk operations (pause/resume/delete)
- Budget management interface
```

### 2. Ad Spend Metrics
```typescript
// TODO: Connect to insights API
- Real-time spend tracking
- Cost per result metrics
- ROAS calculations
- Budget utilization alerts
```

### 3. Audience Management
```typescript
// TODO: Implement audience UI
- Custom audience builder
- Lookalike audience creation
- Audience overlap visualization
```
