### Backup Instructions
To create a backup of the current state:

```bash
# Run the backup script
./scripts/backup/backup-war-room.sh

# Or manually backup specific components:
# Database (requires DATABASE_URL env var)
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backups/warroom-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Uploads and assets
tar -czf backups/uploads-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  src/frontend/public/uploads \
  src/frontend/public/images \
  src/backend/uploads
```

### Environment Requirements
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis (optional, for caching)

### Critical Configuration Files
- `/src/backend/serve_bulletproof.py` - Main server entry point
- `/render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- `/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (root level for Render)
- `/src/frontend/package.json` - Frontend dependencies

### Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Missing logo on production
- ✅ Filter undefined errors in navigation
- ✅ Information Streams data loading
- ✅ Render deployment configuration
- ✅ Single service architecture working

### Monitoring & Logs
- Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
- Application logs available in Render service logs
- Frontend errors logged to browser console
- Backend errors logged to Render service logs

### Next Steps
1. Monitor deployment for stability
2. Set up automated backups on Render
3. Configure custom domain when ready
4. Implement additional monitoring (Sentry, etc.)

### Recovery Instructions
If rollback needed:
1. Use Render dashboard to rollback to previous deployment
2. Or redeploy specific commit: `git push render <commit>:main`
3. Restore database from backup if needed
4. Verify all services are operational
