3. Begin integration test development

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Next 2 hours)
1. Run comprehensive test suites
2. Perform load and stress testing
3. Validate all user journeys
4. Check mobile and browser compatibility

### Phase 3: Hardening & Optimization (Next 4 hours)
1. Review and optimize slow queries
2. Implement additional caching
3. Enhance error messages
4. Standardize logging

### Phase 4: Demo Preparation (Final 2 hours)
1. Create demo environment
2. Prepare demo data
3. Write demo script
4. Practice run-through

## 📊 Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Database connection limits** → Connection pooling implemented
2. **API rate limits** → Caching and throttling in place
3. **Memory leaks** → Monitoring and alerts configured
4. **Security vulnerabilities** → Regular scanning scheduled
5. **Documentation gaps** → Sub-agent analyzing coverage

### Contingency Plans
1. **Fallback deployment** → Bulletproof server ready
2. **Performance degradation** → Auto-scaling configured
3. **Demo failures** → Offline demo mode available
4. **Data loss** → Automated backups running
