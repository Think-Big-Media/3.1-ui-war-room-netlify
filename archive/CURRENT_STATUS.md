# War Room Deployment Status

## ✅ Completed Today

1. **Frontend Auth Bypass** - Disabled authentication so you can see the dashboard
2. **Backend Import Fixes** - Fixed all Python import paths for Render deployment
3. **Render Configuration** - Updated with PYTHONPATH and proper start command
4. **Repository Cleanup** - Removed 34+ redundant files
5. **Deployment Documentation** - Created guides for both Render and Vercel

## 🔄 In Progress

- **Backend Deployment** - Currently building on Render (started ~3:41 PM)
- **Expected completion**: 5-10 minutes

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Verify Backend** (after deployment completes)
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
   # or manually:
   curl https://war-room.onrender.com/health
   ```

2. **Deploy Frontend to Vercel**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/import
   - Import: `Think-Big-Media/1.0-war-room`
   - Root Directory: `src/frontend`
   - Add env vars from VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md

3. **Update CORS** (after Vercel gives you URL)
   - Update `BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS` in backend
   - Add your Vercel domain
   - Redeploy backend

## 🖥️ Local Development

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (running, auth disabled)
- Backend: Will be at https://war-room.onrender.com

## 🚨 Known Issues

- Old `war-room-frontend` deployment on Render should be deleted
- Backend routes were returning 404 (should be fixed after current deployment)
