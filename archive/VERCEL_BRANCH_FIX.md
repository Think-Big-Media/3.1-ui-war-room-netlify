# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Vercel Branch Configuration Fix

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
Vercel is deploying from `main` branch, but all our fixes are in `feature/automation-engine`!

## IMMEDIATE FIX OPTIONS

### Option 1: Change Vercel Branch Settings (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/think-big-media/1.0-war-room/settings/git
2. Change "Production Branch" from `main` to `feature/automation-engine`
3. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Create Preview Deployment
1. Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for non-main branches
2. Look for a deployment URL like: `1-0-war-room-git-feature-automation-engine-think-big-media.vercel.app`

### Option 3: Merge to Main (For Production)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature/automation-engine
git push origin main
```

## Why This Happened
- All our fixes were committed to `feature/automation-engine`
- Vercel's default configuration only deploys from `main`
- The 404 persisted because none of our fixes were being deployed!

## Files That Need to Be on Main
- `/package.json` (root) - Redirects build to frontend
- `/vercel.json` - Configuration
- `/index.html` - Built output
- `/assets/` - All JavaScript/CSS files

## Verification
After fixing the branch:
1. Check deployment says "Source: GitHub (feature/automation-engine)" or "main" with latest commits
2. URL should show Brand BOS dashboard
3. API test should work: `/api/test`
