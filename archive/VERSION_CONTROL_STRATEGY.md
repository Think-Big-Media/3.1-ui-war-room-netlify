## 📋 **Version Control Strategy**

### Git Branching Model
```
main                    # Production-ready code
├── develop            # Integration branch for features
├── feature/analytics  # Feature branches
├── feature/auth       # Isolated development
├── hotfix/critical    # Emergency fixes
└── release/v1.0.0     # Release preparation
```

### Semantic Versioning
