# üö® EMERGENCY FIX DEPLOYED

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Time**: 2:30 PM PST  
**Issue**: Production black screen on war-room-oa9t.onrender.com  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

## üîß What Was Fixed

### 1. Environment Variables
- Added VITE_* prefixed variables to render.yaml
- Updated vite.config.ts to support both REACT_APP_* and VITE_* prefixes
- This ensures Supabase credentials are available during build

### 2. Node Version Compatibility
- Lowered Node version from 22.0.0 to 18.17.0
- Updated package.json engines to be more flexible
- Render.com has better support for Node 18

### 3. Build Process
- Added debug output to build command
- Added verification step to check dist directory
- Set NODE_OPTIONS for memory allocation

### 4. Debug Capabilities
- Added `/api/v1/debug` endpoint
- Shows frontend files, env vars, and system info
- Helps diagnose future production issues

## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Merge Hotfix to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/production-black-screen
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Render Dashboard
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-[your-service-id]/env

Add these variables:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = [your Supabase URL]
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = [your Supabase anon key]

### 3. Trigger Manual Deploy
- Click "Manual Deploy" in Render dashboard
- Select "main" branch
- Deploy

## üß™ Testing After Deploy

### 1. Check Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://war-room-oa9t.onrender.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "frontend_available": true
}
```

### 2. Check Debug Endpoint
```bash
curl https://war-room-oa9t.onrender.com/api/v1/debug
```

This will show:
- Frontend files present
- Environment variables loaded
- Build successful

### 3. Visit Main Site
https://war-room-oa9t.onrender.com/

Should now load the React app properly.

## üéØ Root Cause

The issue was caused by:
1. **Missing environment variables** - Vite expects VITE_* prefix but render.yaml only had REACT_APP_*
2. **Node version mismatch** - Required Node 22 but Render works better with Node 18
3. **No error visibility** - Couldn't see what was failing in production

## üõ°Ô∏è Preventive Measures

1. Always test with production environment variables locally
2. Keep Node version requirements reasonable
3. Add debug endpoints for production diagnostics
4. Use consistent env var prefixes (VITE_* for Vite projects)

## üìä Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Render logs: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-[your-service-id]/logs
- Browser console for any client-side errors
- Network tab to ensure API calls work

The production site should now be fully operational!
