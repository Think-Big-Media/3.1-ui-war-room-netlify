## 🏗️ Implementation Architecture

### Background Task Queue
```yaml
celery:
  broker: redis://localhost:6379
  beat_schedule:
    - campaign_analysis: every 1 hour
    - volunteer_matching: every 6 hours
    - financial_insights: daily at 2 AM
    - document_processing: on demand
```

### Agent Communication
```python
# Inter-agent communication via Redis
class AgentOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.redis_client = redis.Redis()
        
    def publish_insight(self, agent_name, insight):
        self.redis_client.publish(
            f"agent:{agent_name}",
            json.dumps(insight)
        )
```

### API Integration
```python
# FastAPI endpoints for agent interactions
@router.post("/api/v1/agents/{agent_name}/query")
async def query_agent(
    agent_name: str,
    query: AgentQuery,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    agent = get_agent(agent_name)
    result = await agent.process_query(query)
    return result
```

## 📊 Monitoring and Performance

### Key Metrics to Track
- Agent response times
- Accuracy of predictions
- Resource utilization
- Cost per insight generated
- User engagement with agent outputs

### Dashboard Integration
```typescript
// Frontend component for agent insights
const AgentInsights: React.FC = () => {
  const { data: insights } = useAgentInsights();
  
  return (
    <InsightsDashboard
      insights={insights}
      onAction={handleAgentAction}
    />
  );
};
```
