# War Room Platform - Code Examples

This directory contains comprehensive code examples that demonstrate best practices and patterns for the War Room platform. These examples are used by Claude Code's Context Engineering system to generate consistent, high-quality implementations.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `/api/` - Backend API Examples
- **volunteer_endpoints.py** - FastAPI CRUD endpoints with filtering, pagination, and error handling
- **event_endpoints.py** - Complex event management with background tasks, caching, and business logic

### `/frontend/` - React/TypeScript Components
- **VolunteerList.tsx** - List component with Material-UI, hooks, filtering, and state management
- **EventForm.tsx** - Multi-step form with React Hook Form, validation, and file uploads

### `/database/` - Database Layer
- **models.py** - SQLAlchemy models with relationships, mixins, constraints, and indexes
- **queries.py** - Complex queries with CTEs, window functions, and aggregations

### `/authentication/` - Security Implementation
- **auth_service.py** - JWT authentication, password hashing, session management, and RBAC
- **auth_endpoints.py** - Login/logout flows, token refresh, password reset, and OAuth2

### `/testing/` - Test Examples
- **test_volunteer_endpoints.py** - Pytest tests for API endpoints with fixtures and mocking
- **VolunteerList.test.tsx** - Jest/React Testing Library tests with MSW for API mocking

## üéØ Purpose

These examples serve as patterns for Claude Code to follow when implementing new features. They demonstrate:

1. **Consistent Code Style** - Following project conventions and best practices
2. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling and validation
3. **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and data protection
4. **Testing** - Unit and integration tests with good coverage
5. **Documentation** - Clear docstrings and inline comments
6. **Performance** - Caching, pagination, and query optimization

## üîß Usage in Context Engineering

When creating a new feature request in `INITIAL.md`, reference these examples:

```markdown
## Examples to Reference

When implementing this feature, refer to these example patterns:
- `/examples/api/volunteer_endpoints.py` - For API endpoint structure
- `/examples/frontend/VolunteerList.tsx` - For React component patterns
- `/examples/database/models.py` - For database schema design
```

## üìù Adding New Examples

When adding new examples:

1. **Follow Existing Patterns** - Match the style and structure of existing examples
2. **Include Comments** - Add docstrings and inline comments explaining key concepts
3. **Show Best Practices** - Demonstrate error handling, validation, and security
4. **Keep It Focused** - Each example should demonstrate specific patterns clearly
5. **Test Your Examples** - Ensure examples are syntactically correct and functional
