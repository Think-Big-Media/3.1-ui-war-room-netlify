# ðŸš¨ URGENT: CLEANUP RENDER SERVICES

## Problem Identified
You have **5 War Room services** all deploying simultaneously:
1. WarRoom.AI Production (Deploying)
2. 1-0-war-room-v2 (Deploying) 
3. war-room-production (Deploying)
4. warroom-service-aug11 (Deploying)
5. 1.0-war-room (Deploying)

**This is why deployments are failing and taking 30 minutes!**

## Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Stop All Deployments
Click on each service and click "Cancel Deployment" if available

### Step 2: Delete Duplicate Services  
Keep only **ONE** service (recommend: `war-room-production`)

**Delete these services:**
- WarRoom.AI Production
- 1-0-war-room-v2  
- warroom-service-aug11
- 1.0-war-room

### Step 3: Configure The One Remaining Service
On `war-room-production`:

**Build Command:**
```bash
cd src/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt && cd ../.. && rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install && npm run build
```

**Environment Variables:**
- ROLLUP_SKIP_NODE_BUILD = true
- PYTHON_VERSION = 3.11.0
- NODE_VERSION = 20
- PORT = 10000

### Step 4: Deploy
Manual deploy on the one remaining service

## Why This Was Happening
- Multiple services competing for the same GitHub repo
- All hitting the same Rollup error
- Eating up your pipeline minutes
- None completing successfully

## After Cleanup
- One service will deploy in 8-10 minutes
- OAuth will be live
- No more resource waste

---
**DO THIS NOW**: Delete 4 services, keep 1, configure it, deploy it.
