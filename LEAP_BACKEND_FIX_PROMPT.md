# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BACKEND FIX: Remove Frontend Service Blocking API Endpoints

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### PROBLEM
The frontend service in `backend/frontend/encore.service.ts` has a catch-all static file route that serves `index.html` for ALL requests, including API endpoints. This prevents all 30 API endpoints from being accessible, returning HTML instead of JSON.

### ROOT CAUSE
```typescript
// backend/frontend/encore.service.ts
export const assets = api.static({
  path: "/frontend/*path",  // Catches ALL routes including /api/*
  expose: true,
  dir: "./dist",
  notFound: "./dist/index.html",  // Returns HTML for every 404
  notFoundStatus: 200,            // Makes it look successful
});
```

This configuration means:
- `/api/v1/auth/login` â†’ Returns HTML (index.html)
- `/api/v1/users` â†’ Returns HTML (index.html)
- ALL API endpoints â†’ Return HTML instead of JSON

### SOLUTION
Since the frontend will be deployed separately to Netlify, completely remove or disable the frontend service.

## STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Option 1: Comment Out Frontend Service (RECOMMENDED)
```typescript
// backend/frontend/encore.service.ts

// COMMENTED OUT: Frontend now deployed to Netlify
// This was blocking all API endpoints by serving HTML
/*
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";

export const assets = api.static({
  path: "/frontend/*path",
  expose: true,
  dir: "./dist",
  notFound: "./dist/index.html",
  notFoundStatus: 200,
});
*/
```

### Option 2: Delete Frontend Service Entirely
1. Delete the entire `backend/frontend/` directory
2. Remove any imports of the frontend service from other files

## VERIFICATION STEPS

After applying the fix, ask Comet to verify:

1. **Test Auth Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://production-war-room-3-backend-ha6i.frontend.encr.app/api/v1/auth/login
   ```
   Should return: `{"detail":"Method Not Allowed"}` or similar JSON error
   NOT: HTML content

2. **Test User Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://production-war-room-3-backend-ha6i.frontend.encr.app/api/v1/users
   ```
   Should return: JSON error about authentication
   NOT: HTML content

3. **Test Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://production-war-room-3-backend-ha6i.frontend.encr.app/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy"}` or similar JSON
   NOT: HTML content

## EXPECTED OUTCOME

âœ… All API endpoints return JSON responses (even error responses)
âœ… No HTML is served from the backend
âœ… 404 errors return JSON: `{"detail":"Not Found"}`
âœ… Frontend on Netlify can successfully call backend APIs
âœ… Debug panel can connect and test all 30 endpoints

## WHY THIS IS CRITICAL

1. **Current State**: 0 of 30 API endpoints work
2. **After Fix**: All 30 API endpoints accessible
3. **Frontend Ready**: Netlify deployment waiting for this fix
4. **Debug Panel**: Can't test without working endpoints

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- The frontend is now hosted on Netlify (separate from backend)
- The backend should ONLY serve API endpoints, no static files
- This fix unblocks the entire War Room V1 MVP deployment
- After this fix, the frontend debug panel can properly test all endpoints

## DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

1. Apply this fix in Leap.new
2. Have Comet verify endpoints return JSON
3. Deploy backend changes
4. Deploy frontend to Netlify
5. Test end-to-end with debug panel

## REPORT REQUEST

After applying the fix, please provide a brief report including:
1. **What was changed:** Which files were modified
2. **Current status:** Is the frontend service now disabled?
3. **Deployment status:** Was it auto-deployed or needs manual deployment?
4. **Any issues encountered:** Were there any problems or warnings?
5. **Next steps:** What needs to happen for this to be live?
