## üìà Monitoring Dashboard

The system generates an HTML dashboard with:

- **Real-time metrics**: Success rates, optimization counts, performance trends
- **Visual charts**: Success rate over time, optimization type distribution
- **System health**: Component status, error tracking
- **Recent activity**: Latest optimizations and their results

Access via: `agents/data/amp_specialist/reports/performance_dashboard.html`

## üé® Pattern Storage Integration

### Pieces Integration

Successful optimization patterns are automatically stored in Pieces with:

- **Tags**: `amp-optimizations`, `amp-{type}`, `war-room`, `performance`
- **Metadata**: Performance impact, refactoring rules, success metrics
- **Code examples**: Before/after code snippets
- **Context**: File type, language, optimization rationale

### Pattern Retrieval

The system uses stored patterns to:
- Suggest optimizations for similar code structures
- Learn from successful optimization history
- Improve recommendation accuracy over time
- Share patterns across development team

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Pieces integration
export PIECES_CLI_PATH="/path/to/pieces"
export PIECES_API_URL="http://localhost:1000"

- [ ] Validate bundle size changes
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Review performance metrics

## üö® Risk Management

### Risk Assessment

python agents/run_amp_specialist.py --mode=scan --dry-run

# Run full optimization with limits
python agents/run_amp_specialist.py --mode=full --max-optimizations=5

# Generate performance dashboard
python agents/run_amp_specialist.py --mode=report

# Check system status
python -c "
from agents.monitoring_dashboard import MonitoringDashboard
import asyncio
dashboard = MonitoringDashboard('.')
print(asyncio.run(dashboard.get_system_status()))
"
```
