      title: "Unit Test Coverage for Backend Services",
      description: `## Problem
The backend services currently lack comprehensive unit test coverage, making it difficult to ensure reliability and catch regressions early.

## Solution
Achieve 80%+ test coverage for all backend services including:
- Authentication service
- Automation engine
- API endpoints
- Database operations
- WebSocket handlers

## Technical Details
- Use pytest with pytest-cov for coverage reporting
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, database, APIs)
- Test both success and error paths
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Authentication service has 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Automation engine has 80%+ coverage
- [ ] All API endpoints have comprehensive tests
- [ ] Database operations are properly tested with rollback
- [ ] WebSocket handlers have unit tests
- [ ] Coverage report is integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Tests run in under 5 minutes`,

      title: "Frontend Component Testing Suite",
      description: `## Problem
Frontend components lack comprehensive testing, leading to potential UI bugs and regressions that could impact user experience.

## Solution
Implement comprehensive React component testing with React Testing Library and achieve 80%+ coverage for all components.

## Technical Details
- Use Jest with React Testing Library
- Test user interactions and component behavior
- Mock API calls with MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- Test accessibility with jest-axe
- Include snapshot testing for UI consistency

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All components have unit tests
- [ ] User interactions are tested (clicks, form submissions)
- [ ] Redux store integration is tested
- [ ] Error states and loading states are tested
- [ ] Accessibility tests pass
- [ ] 80%+ coverage achieved
- [ ] Tests integrated into CI/CD pipeline`,

      title: "End-to-End Testing with Playwright",
      description: `## Problem
Critical user flows are not tested end-to-end, which could lead to integration issues being discovered only in production.

## Solution
Set up E2E testing framework with Playwright for critical user flows including authentication, campaign creation, and volunteer management.

## Technical Details
- Install and configure Playwright
- Write tests for critical user journeys
- Test across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Include mobile viewport testing
- Set up test data management
- Configure parallel test execution

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Playwright framework is set up and configured
- [ ] Authentication flow is tested E2E
- [ ] Campaign creation and management flow is tested
- [ ] Volunteer management flow is tested
- [ ] Event creation and registration is tested
- [ ] Tests run on multiple browsers
- [ ] Tests are integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test reports are generated automatically`,

      title: "Performance Testing and Optimization",
      description: `## Problem
API endpoint performance and frontend load times are not monitored or optimized, potentially leading to poor user experience under load.

## Solution
Implement performance testing for API endpoints and frontend load times, establish baselines, and optimize bottlenecks.

## Technical Details
- Use Locust or k6 for API load testing
- Implement Lighthouse CI for frontend performance
- Monitor database query performance
- Track Redis cache hit rates
- Profile React components for render performance
- Set up performance budgets

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Load testing framework is implemented
- [ ] API endpoints handle 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Response times are under 200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Frontend Lighthouse score is 90+ for performance
- [ ] Database queries are optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked in monitoring
- [ ] Performance regression tests in CI/CD`,

      title: "Security Audit and Penetration Testing",
      description: `## Problem
The application has not undergone a comprehensive security audit, potentially leaving vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Solution
Conduct a thorough security audit of authentication, API endpoints, and data handling, followed by penetration testing.

## Technical Details
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation and sanitization review
- SQL injection and XSS prevention verification
- API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Secrets management audit
- Third-party dependency vulnerability scanning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OWASP ZAP scan completed and issues resolved
- [ ] Authentication flows are secure (JWT, session management)
- [ ] All inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] API endpoints have proper authorization checks
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented on sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Secrets are properly managed (not in code)
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Penetration test report with no critical findings`,
